# structure
generative story line
some thruths
static location & cards are the lore
- The Cartographer
- Kunsiss and the Metamachine
- Aquitaine the Glass Gnome


### intro
* define quest
* define what teller knows
* give clue about person/item/location
* perhaps you should go there on your own.
** Then someone talk about this person/place -> tie it to a location

### map
* see map for first time
* 3-4 locations - minimal
* pick a location
** When you pick a location, generate it (ruined, generative, written)
** Map should evolve, glitch, be missing parts.
** Location should move around, disorient. (the cartographer moves somewhere else.)
