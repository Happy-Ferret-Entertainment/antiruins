  These place are always there, kind of like anchors.
  While everything seems to shift around me.
  I sometime wonder if most of this is real, or just the product of my imagination.

  ??? Fake places, real places? (illusion, memory, material)

  But when I go to these place, I know they're real.
  I remember them, and I can almost see the faces of those dear to me.

  I just hope they don't turn up like these ruins all around,
  But I know I can't preserve them...

  Working on a metamachine.
  One that can visualize our fascination.

  ??? What is you fascination, my dear traveller?

  I believe that Living Creature have a special sense.
  One that is not unlike the way particules communicate.
  
  Have you never been fascinated by some idea, some person?
  So much that you can almost penetrate their brain, figure out their intention?

  ??? I've known someone with that fascination.

  Perhaps I am mad, am I not able to be in someone else's brain?
  My metamachine will prove that one can be syncronazied with another.
  Entangled spirits if you will.
  Oh, what if someone is also working on this same machine, elsewhere,
  unaware of my progress? Unaware of my existence? 



Observer (quantum mechanic) quelque chose qui nous fascine = 
enregistrer ces information et les imiter (nous sommes entangled)

--[[ Roby
Person who can never finish his project.
Slitghy sad, infinite discovery and knowledge.
Perhaps the discovery and learning is as important as the act of closure.
The act of closure allow recognition,
but I't probably fine to die forgotten and content?

I've got a spirit, it's made out of sand.
Nolet's death.

Someone half reborn, ligners in between death and live.
There are still things to be done, otherwise I casn't die in peace (Roby's Nemesis?)

Are the thing left to do imoprtant in life?
  What does Nolet Search for (his soul)
